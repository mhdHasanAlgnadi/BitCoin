# BitCoin
An Application to Track the Bitcoin Value
This application retrieves the Bitcoin value through a Web service API in JSON format
and then converts the file format to a String of Characters and then displays the value
according to the currency of country chosen by the user within the application. In this
application I dealt with the SwiftyJSON library for conversion from the JSON format to 
the String as I dealt with the Alamofire library for processing Internet connection.
